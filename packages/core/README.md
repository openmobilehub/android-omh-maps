# Module core

## Overview

The Core package is the backbone of the map feature, mainly providing common interfaces that the plugins use. This setup ensures smooth and predictable interactions between the plugins and the rest of the application. Besides these interfaces, the Core package also offers mechanisms for setting up and handling maps. Additionally, it includes utilities for checking network connectivity and for logging activities.
