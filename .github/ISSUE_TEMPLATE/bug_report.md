**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.


**Environment**
- **Open Mobile Hub SDK Version:** 
- **Android SDK Version:** 
- **Device/Emulator Model:** 
- **Android OS Version:** 
- **Build Tools Version (if applicable):** 
- **IDE Version (e.g., Android Studio):**

**Prerequisites**
- [ ] I have searched the existing issues and confirm that this is not a duplicate.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. 
2. 

Detail the steps required to reproduce the issue. This should include any specific setup required, such as particular device configurations, network conditions, or user permissions.

**Expected Behavior**
Describe what you expected to happen when you performed the above steps.

**Actual Behavior**
Describe what actually happened instead. Include full error messages, stack traces, and screenshots if possible.

**Code Snippets (Optional)**
If applicable, include minimal code snippets that demonstrate the problem. Please use markdown code blocks for formatting.

**Screenshots/Video**
If applicable, add screenshots or a video to help explain your problem. This can be particularly useful for visual issues or complex interaction bugs.

**Logcat Output**
Include relevant logcat output, which can provide critical insights into what went wrong. Use markdown code blocks to ensure the log is readable.

<!-- Notes for Using the Template:

- **Environment:** Detailed environment information is crucial for reproducing the issue accurately. Differences in Android versions, devices, or SDK versions can significantly impact behavior.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** The more precise you can be here, the easier it will be to identify and fix the issue. Remember that what seems obvious to you might not be to someone else.
- **Code Snippets:** Providing minimal but complete examples of the code that triggers the bug can significantly speed up the debugging process.
- **Logcat Output:** Android's log output is invaluable for diagnosing runtime problems. Include any logs that contain exceptions, errors, or warnings relevant to the bug.
- **Screenshots/Video:** Visual evidence can be extremely helpful, especially for UI-related issues or complex interactions that are difficult to describe in words. -->
